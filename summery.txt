## Project Summary

### Build Configuration
The project uses Gradle build scripts (`build.gradle.kts`). It includes the following plugins:
- Android application and Kotlin support plugins.
- Google Services and Firebase Crashlytics plugins for analytics and monitoring.
- Support for Jetpack Compose framework for UI development.

The `compileSdk`, `minSdk`, and `targetSdk` versions are set to 35 and 23 respectively.

A dependence on Firebase and Parse is defined for authentication and backend services. Core Material Design is used for visuals.

### App Codebase

#### App.kt
This file initializes Firebase and Back4App services with configurations provided in string resources. The class extends the Android `Application` and registers all Parse model subclasses.

#### MainActivity.kt
This file represents the main activity of the app and sets up the UI scaffolding using Jetpack Compose themes. A Parse connectivity test runs on app launch, sending a test object for verification.

It defines composable functions:
- `Greeting(name: String)` displays a greeting message.

### Backend Implementation

#### Data Models
The project implements a comprehensive backend using Parse Server and Firebase as described in the backend architecture document.

- **User Model**: Extends ParseUser with role-based access (Farmer/GeneralUser), Firebase UID integration, and profile functionality.
- **ProductListing Model**: Manages product details with traceability features and seller references.
- **Order Model**: Handles transactions between buyers and sellers with status workflow (Pending→Confirmed→Shipped→Delivered→Completed).
- **Media Model**: Stores and manages images/videos for products and user profiles.
- **Feedback Models**: Two separate models for user-to-user and product feedback with ratings and comments.

#### Repository Layer
Repository classes implement business logic with proper ACL enforcement:

- **UserRepository**: Manages user authentication with Firebase-Parse integration, creating synchronized identities across platforms.
- **ProductRepository**: Handles product CRUD operations with seller-specific permissions.
- **OrderRepository**: Manages order workflows with role-specific status transitions.
- **FeedbackRepository**: Handles feedback submission with verification that users have completed transactions.

#### Security Implementation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Uses Parse Roles to differentiate between Farmer and General Users.
- **Object-Level ACL**: Each object sets appropriate read/write permissions (e.g., only sellers can edit their listings).
- **Permission Validation**: Business logic validates operations based on user roles and object ownership.

### Themes and Styles

#### Theme.kt
It defines dynamic dark and light color schemes using Compose Material 3 abstractions.

#### Color.kt
It declares static color variables for different parts of the UI, used in theme definition.

All UI components comply with the default system-wide theme or dynamic configurations from Android 12 onward.

This project is structured around modern Android development practices with Jetpack Compose for UI, Firebase for authentication and real-time features, and Back4App (Parse) for structured data storage with proper access control.
